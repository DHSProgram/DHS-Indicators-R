# NOTES ON DISCONTINUATION RATES --------------------------------------------------------------
# When calculating discontinuation rates using event files note that the denominator in this table 
# is all women, including sterilized women also includes missing methods to match the final reports.



# STEP 1 ------------------------------

# STEP 1 NOTES
# Calculate exposure, late entries and censoring for the	period 3-62 months prior to the interview
	

	# gen wt
	IRdata <- IRdata %>%
	  mutate(wt = v005/1000000)

	# drop events that were ongoing when calendar began
	drop if v017 == ev900

	# drop births, terminations, pregnancies, and episodes of non-use
	# keep missing methods. to exclude missing change 99 below to 100.
	drop if (ev902 > 80 & ev902 < 99) | ev902==0 

	#  time from beginning of event to interview
	gen tbeg_int = v008 - ev900
	label var tbeg_int "time from beginning of event to interview"

	# time from end of event to interview
	gen tend_int = v008 - ev901
	label var tend_int "time from end of event to interview"

	# discontinuation variable
	gen discont = 0
	replace discont = 1 if ev903 != 0

	# censoring those who discontinue in last three months
	replace discont = 0 if tend_int < 3
	label var discont "discontinuation indicator"
	tab discont
	tab ev903 discont, m

	# generate late entry variable
	gen entry = 0
	replace entry = tbeg_int - 62 if tbeg_int >= 63
	tab tbeg_int entry

	# taking away exposure time outside of the 3 to 62 month window
	gen exposure = ev901a
	replace exposure = ev901a - (3 - tend_int) if tend_int < 3
	recode exposure -3/0=0

	# drop those events that started in the month of the interview and two months prior
	drop if tbeg_int < 3

	# drop events that started and ended before 62 months prior to survey
	drop if tbeg_int > 62 & tend_int > 62

	# to remove sterilized women from denominator use the command below - not used for DHS standard
	*replace exposure = . if ev902 == 6

	# censor any discontinuations that are associated with use > 59 months (not censored here in this example)
	*replace discont = 0 if (exposure - entry) > 59


#  Step 2 -----------
# Recode contraceptive methods, discontinuation reason and construct switching


#  recode contraceptive method
# : IUD, Periodic Abstinence, and Withdrawal skipped and grouped with other due to small numbers of cases. You can tab ev902 to examine categories with few cases.

	
	recode ev902 						# /

		(5  = 5 "Male condom")				# /
	/*	(8  = 6 "Periodic abstinence") */  # /
	/*	(9  = 7 "Withdrawal") */			# /
		(13 18 = 8 "LAM/EC")				# /
		(nonmissing = 9 "Other")			# /
		(missing = .), gen(method)
		
	tab ev902 method, m

		Days Method	plus IUD, Periodic Abstinence, Withdrawal
